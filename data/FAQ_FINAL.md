## Dormulin Vegetative

Dormulin Vegetative is useful at the early growth stage. It helps plants recover from stress caused by diseases, nutrient shortage, or climate changes. It promotes strong root and shoot growth, healthy green leaves, and overall vigorous development. By making plants stronger, it reduces the need for excess pesticide sprays.

Use Dormulin Vegetative at the vegetative stage for healthy growth and higher yields.

## Dormulin Flowering

Dormulin Flowering is designed for the flowering stage. It reduces flower drop, increases the number of flowers, and improves fruit setting. It strengthens plants against stresses such as pests, diseases, drought, heat, or nutrient deficiency. This ensures more flowers, better quality, and improved yield.

Use Dormulin Flowering during the flowering stage to achieve better results.

## Zetol Select for Banana

### Banana Rooting Stage
- Fertilizer ratio: 20:16:17 through fertigation
- Benefits: Supports profuse root and stem growth, better nutrient absorption, and early leaf development. Ensures fast and healthy establishment of banana plants.

### Banana Vegetative and Booting Stage
- Fertilizer ratio: 11:18:23
- Benefits: Provides balanced nutrition, promotes sustained canopy growth, supports early emergence of inflorescence, and increases flower-to-fruit set ratio.

### Banana Bunch and Fruit Development Stage
